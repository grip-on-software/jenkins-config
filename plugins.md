This is a list of plugins that are installed on the Jenkins server in order to
run the Declarative Pipeline multibranch jobs for the GROS project. We only list
the primary dependencies, as many plugins will install additional dependencies
based on their current version. Where possible, we list the installed version,
although due to security and update considerations this list should not be seen
as representative for any current or recommended installation, merely providing
a guideline at setting up a Jenkins instance.
